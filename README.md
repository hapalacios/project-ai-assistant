# project-ai-assistant
AI Assistant is a project with two voice recognition apps: chatbot assistant with voice recognition capabilities and a prototype of an AI assistant to help you to read news, obtain useful information about the weather, time and get some help with remainders about your daily tasks. Bonus: text editor with voice dictation is going to be ready in sprint 2-3.

# Project Overview
## 1.1 Description

Alan, my personal assistant, or Alan AI Assistant v1.0, is an application built to help users keep track of their daily activities and tasks, inform about the news on the internet and read them to the user; also check the weather and notify the user of that any time he/she requests an update. Bonus: the application also allows writing/reading text documents and navigating between web pages using voice commands.

These advanced functionalities could help people to operate computers only using voice commands. Additionally, this AI Assistant could be your virtual friend and have some fun conversations! 
To let the user feel that experience, this bundle also has a conversation chatbot that mocks applications like WhatsUp or Facebook messenger, but with the voice capability included.

Note: Writing/Dictating functionality and more advanced voice scripts to have fun conversations will be ready on sprint 2 and 3. User authentication, text files, interactions and discussions will be stored using MySQL DB on sprint 3.

## 1.2 Problem

Problems and Solutions:
To keep track and have exemplary performance in our daily activities and tasks. Note: The average professional in the work-force, and students, get lost easily in hundreds of daily activities.
Help people decide based on questions about the weather in any city and news on the internet.
Help people with accessibility problems to control a computer.
A virtual friend to talk and request data, information and task activities is good therapy and helps people speak with “someone” in these problematic pandemic days. For that reason, another version of this project could solely focus on covering that purpose in the future.

# Releases
## 1.1 Beta 1.0

First sprint done in one week testing Alan AI, creating project doc proposal. Basic hints in carousel.

## 1.1 Beta 1.1

Second sprint done in one additional week. Improvements in icons, styling. Added more hints in carousel.

## 1.1 Beta 1.2

Third sprint. Authentication user added using mysql db. Also there is an option to run the app in test mode, without using a user or db.

RIGHT NOW: fixing some bugs in dictation and adding tasks functions. 

Also, was detected a bug using API in first app, conversation app (mock of fb messenger). For that reason call to API is disabled to collect ramdon users. Solution: will add data from api ramdom users to a json file, and after that to the same to mysql db.
